- Install the [ZigBrains](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/22456-zigbrains) plugin from the marketplace
- Restart the IDE (necessary for the plugin to integrate itself correctly)

If you have both `zig` and `zls` in your `PATH`, then the plugin should automatically detect both.

If not, Go to `Settings` -> `Languages & Frameworks` -> `Zig`, and point the `Toolchain Location` and `ZLS path` to the zig compiler's directory and the ZLS executable, respectively.

If everything is set up correctly, an LSP status indicator should appear in the bottom right corner and turn to green when you open a .zig file in the editor.
