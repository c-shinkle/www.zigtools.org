[]($section.id('vscode-banner'))

**VS Code** users only need the [official Zig Language extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ziglang.vscode-zig).

*No need to manually install Zig or ZLS.*

[]($section.id('build-from-source'))

## Build From Source

To built ZLS from source, run the following commands:

```=html
<pre><code id="build-from-source-code"></code></pre>
```

If you wish to add Zig or ZLS to your `$PATH` please refer to the [Zig Getting Started Guide](https://ziglang.org/learn/getting-started/#direct-download).

[]($section.id('zig-zls-version-compatibility'))
## Zig + ZLS version compatibility

If you decide to install Zig or ZLS through a different method (e.g. package managers), make sure that you install compatible versions:
- A tagged release of Zig should be used with the same tagged release of ZLS (and vice versa). 
- A nightly build of Zig should be used with a nightly build of ZLS (and vice versa).

The install tool above will automatically resolve compatible Zig and ZLS versions.

## Next steps

After installing ZLS, please head over to the "Editor Configuration" section to set up the editor(s) of your choice.
