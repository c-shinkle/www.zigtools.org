The following options can be set on a per-project basis by placing `zls.build.json` in the project root directory next to `build.zig`.

| Option                  | Type             | Default value | What it Does                                                                                                                                              |
| ----------------------- | ---------------- | ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `relative_builtin_path` | `?[]const u8`    | `null`        | If present, this path is used to resolve `@import("builtin")`                                                                                             |
| `build_options`         | `?[]BuildOption` | `null`        | If present, this contains a list of user options to pass to the build. This is useful when options are used to conditionally add packages in `build.zig`. |

#### `BuildOption`

`BuildOption` is defined as follows:

```zig
const BuildOption = struct {
    name: []const u8,
    value: ?[]const u8 = null,
};
```

When `value` is present, the option will be passed the same as in `zig build -Dname=value`. When `value` is `null`, the option will be passed as a flag instead as in `zig build -Dflag`.
